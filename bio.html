  	  	My education began with The British school in Seoul right after my father took a job to run a financial institution in Korea. It was a new start for his career, but a tremendous challenge to my childhood, from cold weather to spicy food to unknown foreign languages. But very soon I became part of the global village through active participation in soccer, basketball and baseball games, eventually gaining the friendship of people from many countries.

  	  	Years later, we came back to Taiwan, and tough times retuned, I couldn't even write my name in Chinese, although I was born here. Accompanied by tears and laugher, my parents had to guess hard what my homework was because my funny characters didn't make sense to them. Nevertheless I passed all my tests that year with stellar scores. That's me: when the environment is difficult, I change my attitude to engage it with passion, enthusiasm, and perseverance.

  	  	Unlike typical Taiwanese schools that focused on academic works only, my school aimed at a well-rounded education with very challenging sports events. We had to swim three thousand meters across Sun Moon Lake at grade ten, and cycle twelve days around Taiwan at eleventh grade. These were physically difficult; just imagine swimming couple hours in a freezing mountain lake, or peddling uphill for eight hours under a burning sun. It scared many people including myself at the beginning, but somehow I was in love with the challenges, with sweat pouring and feet burning. I was happy to encounter and remember my country like this, inch by inch and second by second. This is who I am: all the external challenges created an intimate reason to prevail.

  	  	Being a lucky and happy child, I could feel satisfied with all my happiness until I volunteered to assist a poor farming village in a very hot summer at grade ten. The fierce sun burnt my face and mosquitoes were sucking my blood while I sweated like a pig, helping harvest peanuts. After the tedious hard work, I sold $30 dollars’ worth peanuts for the farmer, I had never been so happy because for the first time I was useful not only to myself but also to others. I had never realized that sharing and helping would create such wonderful satisfaction for me. But since my hard labor in the peanut field was worth only thirty dollars a day, I must form a social enterprise if I am going do more for the poor and minorities. I should further equip myself with interdisciplinary knowledge in fields as diverse as economics, sociology, finance and mathematics. Decisively, I believe that operating a social enterprise is a noteworthy lifetime goal.

  	  	However, in March 2014, Taiwan students occupied the congress building in Taiwan for 24 days. The protest, called the “Sunflower Student Movement“, was triggered by a hasty passage of the service trade agreement with China. Thousands of students supported this protest, providing food, sleeping bags and medical service because they worried about jobs that could be taken by Chinese migrants, hence compromising life quality. Initially, I was confused about what was happening to Taiwan and causing the frustration of the young. Actually, it is not about politics, China, or free trade agreements, it’s about college graduates' vanishing dreams of an “affordable life”. Many also blamed the financial crises and the Fed’s QE (quantitative easing), allowing huge amounts of hot money flooding into our financial and real estate markets, while income distribution worsens and society polarizes. The Sunflower Movement can be seen as another version of “Occupy Wall Street.”

  	  	Determined to understand and resolve the challenges of Taiwan, I started to self-study economics. Reading textbooks and financial news; I also supplemented my learning with videos online. Additionally, I needed to embrace the real world, reaching out to people of various backgrounds to learn facts and opinions from different angles, since simply relying on academic work is insufficient to comprehend all the challenges of daily life. When concepts were hard to grasp, I discussed the issues with my Dad for he is a professional in this field. I also took the AP Economics test to reveal how much I have learned.

  	  	 My hobby: being skillful in Asian chess “Go”, I foresee a couple dozen moves ahead and think out of the box. For example, when the economy is slow, the central bank cuts the interest rate to reduce the cost of borrowing and encourages investment and consumption. But this policy does not work well in Taiwan. Through discussions and studies, eventually I realized that economic theory should be adjusted according to the related demographics, and since Taiwan is an aging society, seniors mainly hold wealth and they become pure consumers after retirement. Abnormally low interest rates force seniors to save more and retire later. This unintended consequence dampens demand and hurts the job market for the young. Constant ultra low interest rates also push up housing prices, forcing young people to save more for housing. Again, this further reduces their disposable income. So, keeping the interest rates near zero for so long not only fails to improve but actually hurts the economy in Taiwan and Japan.

  	  	  I also question Taiwan government’s manipulation on all policy tools like exchange rate, interest rate and tax rate to subsidize our export sector. As a result, we overly engage global supply chains and rely too much on foreign markets; we have become too vulnerable to external shock. With currency undervalued and capital underpriced, our income distribution distorts and living standards fall below our contribution to the world. One day I will ameliorate these serious economic issues by setting up a social enterprise. With enthusiasm to pursue the good in life, I am planning to enter the financial industry after graduation. After gaining some experience in the industry, I would seek the opportunity to operate a social enterprise to contribute to the society.
